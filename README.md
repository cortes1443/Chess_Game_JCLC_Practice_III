## Project Description

This project is fully developed in **Java** and is designed to syntactically validate chess games written in **SAN (Standard Algebraic Notation)** using regular expressions.

If the game passes the syntax validation, the program generates a **binary tree** to visualize the turns of the match. In this tree, each node represents a move: white moves are added as left children and black moves as right children, starting from the root node named `"Partida"`.

This tool is useful for quickly analyzing the structure of a chess game and ensuring it follows correct notation.
